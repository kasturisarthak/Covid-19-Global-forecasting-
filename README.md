This is week 5 of Kaggle's COVID-19 forecasting series, following the Week 4 competition. This competition has some changes from prior weeks - be sure to check the Evaluation and Data pages for more details. All of the prior discussion forums have been migrated to this competition for continuity.

Background
The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) pulled together a coalition research groups and companies (including Kaggle) to prepare the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) to attempt to address key open scientific questions on COVID-19. Those questions are drawn from National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s (NASEM) and the World Health Organization (WHO).

The Challenge
Kaggle is launching a companion COVID-19 forecasting challenges to help answer a subset of the NASEM/WHO questions. While the challenge involves developing quantile estimates intervals for confirmed cases and fatalities between May 12 and June 7 by region, the primary goal isn't only to produce accurate forecasts. It’s also to identify factors that appear to impact the transmission rate of COVID-19.

Companies and Organizations
There is also a call to action for companies and other organizations: If you have datasets that might be useful, please upload them to Kaggle’s dataset platform and reference them in this forum thread. That will make them accessible to those participating in this challenge and a resource to the wider scientific community.
